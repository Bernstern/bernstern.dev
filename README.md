Hi there, this is where the source for my portfolio site is kept. After seeing way too many portfolio sites designed off of the same 15 templates, I wanted to do something a little different. Often I view my own career and life to an extend as a series of decisions or commits so it felt natural to make a site that showed those commits and what better way to model that than Github.

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add a ReadME to view at the root level
- [ ] Add a built in viewer for any pdfs in the repo
- [ ] Git Tree
- [ ] Make sure mobile is properly supported
- [ ] Make the dates for commits auto update
- [ ] Move the content to a cdn
